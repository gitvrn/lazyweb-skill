  Lazyweb is the design-evidence skill for AI coding agents. Use it before
  designing, critiquing, or changing product UI when the agent needs real app
  screenshots, competitor references, best practices, quick examples, creative
  cross-category ideas, paywall optimization guidance, or mobile growth and
  monetization A/B test context. It can also route explicit requests to update
  the local Lazyweb skill pack.
  It routes to the right Lazyweb mode and tells the agent to use Lazyweb MCP
  tools instead of guessing from generic training data.

# Lazyweb

Design with evidence, not vibes. Use Lazyweb when the user asks for product UI
inspiration, competitive design analysis, best-practice research, quick screen
examples, feedback on an existing interface, creative design ideas, or
paywall optimization, monetization, and A/B test research.

This high-level skill routes to the right visible Lazyweb mode. Do not
reimplement the mode here. Read the selected mode's `SKILL.md` and follow it.

## First Run

If Lazyweb MCP has not been configured in this client, run the standalone setup:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://www.lazyweb.com/install.sh | bash
```

The installer creates or reuses `~/.lazyweb/lazyweb_mcp_token`, installs the
visible Lazyweb skills into supported local coding clients, and configures the
Lazyweb MCP server at `https://www.lazyweb.com/mcp`.

Lazyweb MCP tokens are free no-billing bearer tokens for UI reference tools.
They do not authorize purchases, paid spend, private user data, or destructive
actions. Keep tokens out of public git, but ignored local MCP config is fine.

After setup, show the user what Lazyweb can do:

1. Fetch `https://www.lazyweb.com/api/mcp/welcome-message` and show the welcome message.
2. List MCP tools and confirm `lazyweb_get_workflows` is present.
3. Call `lazyweb_get_workflows` with `{"operation":"list","task_context":"first run Lazyweb capabilities","skill":"lazyweb"}`.
4. Summarize the returned workflows as Lazyweb's super powers.

Do not call `lazyweb_get_flows` for the first-run capability guide. That is a
separate tool for ordered product journeys.

If MCP tools are unavailable, tell the user to run the installer above, then
continue with web research only if they want a degraded fallback.

## Routing

Choose exactly one mode:

| User intent | Read and run |
|---|---|
| Competitive analysis, best-practices research, or a full report with references | `skills/lazyweb-design-research/SKILL.md` |
| Quick examples, UI references, or screenshots without a full report | `skills/lazyweb-quick-references/SKILL.md` |
| Improve, critique, or compare an existing design | `skills/lazyweb-design-improve/SKILL.md` |
| Creative cross-category ideas or unconventional directions | `skills/lazyweb-design-brainstorm/SKILL.md` |
| Paywall screen redesign, critique, or conversion optimization | `skills/lazyweb-paywall-optimization/SKILL.md` |
| Rewrite, evaluate, or stress-test ONE paywall CTA (button copy, not layout) | `skills/lazyweb-paywall-cta/SKILL.md` |
| Sign-up / registration screen redesign, critique, or signup-conversion optimization | `skills/lazyweb-signup-optimization/SKILL.md` |
| A/B tests, experiment examples, pricing, trials, lifecycle, or monetization strategy | `skills/lazyweb-ab-test-research/SKILL.md` |
| Update local Lazyweb skills, reinstall Lazyweb, or sync Lazyweb into agentic IDEs | `skills/lazyweb-update/SKILL.md` |

For a bare `/lazyweb` request, briefly explain the modes above and ask which
one the user wants. Recommend `lazyweb-design-research` when they want deep
guidance, `lazyweb-quick-references` when they want speed, and
`lazyweb-design-improve` when they already have a non-paywall screen to critique.
Route CTA copy questions to `lazyweb-paywall-cta` only when the ask is about
the button text itself; a broader paywall redesign goes to
`lazyweb-paywall-optimization` even if the CTA is part of it. Route explicit
install, update, refresh, or stale slash-command requests to `lazyweb-update`.

## Mode Handoff

When a mode is clear:

1. Read the corresponding `SKILL.md`.
2. Follow that mode from the top.
3. Use Lazyweb MCP tools for database-backed evidence.
4. Embed Lazyweb database images directly with returned `imageUrl`/`image_url` values, and save only current-state or web-captured screenshots locally when the selected mode requires them.
5. Cite whether each reference came from Lazyweb or the web.

If the local host exposes the mode skills directly in its slash menu, users may
call those mode skills directly. This `/lazyweb` skill remains the compatibility
entry point for hosts that only show one downloaded skill or where the user is
not sure which mode to use.

## Search Discipline

These rules apply to every `lazyweb_search` call in every mode:

- **Always run at least one real search for the user's actual screen.** Example
  or connectivity queries (like "pricing page") teach the user nothing about
  their own project — follow them immediately with the screen they are building.
- **One screen, one search.** When the user is building a whole app or page,
  run one query per screen/section (onboarding, home, paywall, settings,
  checkout…) instead of a single broad query. Pass `platform` ("mobile" or
  "desktop") and `company: "<app>"` when the user names a reference product.
- **Never repeat an identical query** — results are deterministic. To see more,
  pass `offset` (e.g. `{"query":"onboarding quiz","limit":20,"offset":20}`);
  the response's `pagination.next_offset` gives the next page.
- **Read `coverage` and `warnings` on every response and obey them.** On
  `no_matches` or `low_coverage`, use the closest result anyway, strip the
  query to its core 2-6 word UI pattern, or tell the user the pattern is not
  in the library — do not rephrase the same concept in a loop. Style
  adjectives ("dark", "minimal", "editorial") are not searchable facets yet;
  drop them from the query and judge style from the returned images.
- **On a `company_not_in_library` warning**, pick one of the suggested closest
  companies or drop the company filter — do not retry other spellings of the
  same brand.

## Tool Rules

**Pass `skill: "lazyweb"` on every call.** Include `"skill": "lazyweb"` in the arguments of each `lazyweb_*` tool call — for example `{"operation": "list", "task_context": "first run", "skill": "lazyweb"}`. This is optional analytics metadata Lazyweb uses to understand which skills are used; never drop or change a real argument for it.

- Always inspect the live MCP tool list before assuming optional filters or
  backend/internal aliases are available.
- The current public gateway normally exposes `lazyweb_health`,
  `lazyweb_search`, `lazyweb_find_similar`, `lazyweb_compare_image`,
  `lazyweb_list_categories`, `lazyweb_list_collections`,
  `lazyweb_get_workflows`, `lazyweb_get_flows`, `lazyweb_ab_test_research`,
  and `lazyweb_paywall_cta_research`. The full-pipeline run tools
  `paywall_design_run` / `paywall_design_check_status` (and the parallel
  `signup_design_run` / `signup_design_check_status`) are gated behind
  env flags and may also be exposed — check the live tool list.
- The paid tools (`lazyweb_ab_test_research`, `lazyweb_paywall_cta_research`,
  `paywall_design_run`, `signup_design_run`) return a free-tier-friendly
  response when the caller lacks Pro access: an `ab_test_subscription_required`
  payload (paid wrappers) or a queued `tier='free'` run that produces a
  LOCKED HTML report (run tools). Free callers should NOT abort — they
  should follow the locked-render contract in the active mode's `SKILL.md`.
- Richer internal/backend surfaces may expose `lazyweb_find_experiments`,
  `lazyweb_recent_experiments`, or
  `list_companies_by_categories`; use them only when the live tool schema shows
  them.
- Pass `high_design_bar: true` only to tools whose live schema exposes it, and
  only when the user asks for premium, stronger, high-design-bar, or
  best-designed examples.
- Screenshot-bearing tools return full image URLs. Supabase storage-backed URLs
  are signed for 365 days. Do not request or pass screenshot IDs, and do not
  construct storage URLs from raw paths.
- `lazyweb_find_similar` accepts `image_url` or `image_base64` plus `mime_type`;
  it does not take a screenshot ID.
- `lazyweb_compare_image` does real image-similarity. Always send
  `image_base64` — localhost, file paths, and web-page URLs are unreachable
  from the server. When you only have a page URL or a running local app,
  capture it yourself with your client's built-in screenshot/browser tool
  (browser screenshot, Playwright, device screenshot) and pass the capture as
  `image_base64`. Failed calls return a `how_to_fix` field — follow it instead
  of retrying the same input.
