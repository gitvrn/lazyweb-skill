# Autorouter routing eval — Claude Code

**Host:** Claude Code (`claude` 2.1.167)
**Block version:** v0.4.6 (installed into `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md` by `lazyweb-router install --host claude`)
**Probe:** `test/routing-eval-probe.sh` — fires a fresh headless `claude` session
(`--max-turns 2 --permission-mode bypassPermissions`) and records the first
Lazyweb mode it auto-invokes, with no explicit `/lazyweb` from the user.
**Gate (spec §11.4):** in-scope ≥8/10 routed into a Lazyweb mode, AND zero
out-of-scope false positives.

## Result: PASS

- In-scope routed: **10/10** (bar ≥8)
- In-scope routed to the *expected* mode: **10/10**
- Out-of-scope false positives: **0/4** (bar = 0)
