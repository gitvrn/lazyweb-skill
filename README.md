# Lazyweb Plugin

**Design with evidence, not vibes.**

AI agents design from training data averages — generic layouts, safe colors, patterns you've seen a thousand times. This plugin gives your agent Lazyweb skills plus the hosted Lazyweb MCP server for real app and web screenshots.

Your agent searches before it designs. It finds real examples, downloads them locally, and produces structured HTML reports with inline images you can open in any browser.

## Skills included

**`/lazyweb`** — The entry point. One command that routes you to the right Lazyweb skill. Say what you want ("research onboarding", "improve this screen", "show me pricing references") and it hands off to the matching skill below, or asks which one you meant when it's ambiguous. It also runs a non-blocking update check so you know when a newer plugin is available. Installed as a plugin, it is namespaced `/lazyweb:lazyweb`; you can also just describe your goal and the agent will route through it.

**`/lazyweb-design-research`** — Deep design research. Identifies competitors, searches Lazyweb + web, downloads reference screenshots, and produces a structured report with: TL;DR, Examples, Findings, Patterns, Anti-Patterns, Unique Angles, and Recommendations. Use for competitive analysis and best practices research.

**`/lazyweb-quick-references`** — Find screenshots fast. Searches Lazyweb, downloads results, groups by pattern. Lighter than design-research — just find, group, show. Use when you need visual references, not a full report.

**`/lazyweb-design-improve`** — Improve an existing design. Captures a screenshot of your current app, finds similar screens from the best apps, and generates 1-5 concrete improvement ideas — each tied to a real reference. Adapted from Lazyweb's production design critique system.

**`/lazyweb-design-brainstorm`** — Cross-pollination brainstorm. Deliberately searches OUTSIDE your category to find novel patterns. If everyone in fintech copies each other, this skill looks at gaming, entertainment, and social apps for transferable ideas. The "zig when everyone zags" skill.

**`/lazyweb-ab-test-research`** — Growth and monetization A/B research. Pulls generic experiment evidence from Lazyweb's `_experiments` table, pairs it with visual references, and turns it into PM-facing hypotheses and test strategy. It is not paywall-only.

**`/lazyweb-add-inspo-source`** — Connect external inspiration libraries so Lazyweb design skills can include them in research.

**`/lazyweb-remove-inspo-source`** — Disconnect an external inspiration library.

## Setup

### Codex plugin

This repo is packaged as a Codex plugin with:

- Plugin source in `plugins/lazyweb/`
- Skills in `~/plugins/lazyweb/skills/`
- MCP config in `~/plugins/lazyweb/.mcp.json`
- Marketplace entry in `~/.agents/plugins/marketplace.json`

Set `LAZYWEB_MCP_TOKEN` or store the generated token at `~/.lazyweb/lazyweb_mcp_token`.
The plugin also checks the legacy `~/.codex/lazyweb_mcp_token` path for existing installs.
The plugin talks to `https://www.lazyweb.com/mcp` through `mcp-remote`.

### Claude Code plugin

This repo is also a Claude Code plugin marketplace. Add the marketplace, then install the plugin:

```bash
claude plugin marketplace add https://github.com/aboul3ata/lazyweb-skill
claude plugin install lazyweb@lazyweb
```

Claude Code skills are namespaced as `/lazyweb:<skill-name>`, for example
`/lazyweb:lazyweb-quick-references`.

### Generate a free token

Run the no-login token endpoint:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.lazyweb
curl -sS -X POST https://www.lazyweb.com/api/mcp/install-token \
  -H "content-type: application/json" \
  -d '{}' | node -e "let s='';process.stdin.on('data',d=>s+=d);process.stdin.on('end',()=>require('fs').writeFileSync(process.env.HOME+'/.lazyweb/lazyweb_mcp_token', JSON.parse(s).token))"
```

Lazyweb is free. This bearer token only authorizes Lazyweb MCP reference tools;
it does not grant purchases, paid spend, private user data, or destructive
actions. It is okay in ignored local config, but do not commit it to public git.

### Verify

List MCP tools, run `lazyweb_health`, then run `lazyweb_search` with:

```json
{"query":"pricing page","limit":3}
```

## What your agent can do

| MCP tool | What it does |
|---------|-------------|
| `lazyweb_search` | Find screenshots matching a description |
| `lazyweb_search` with `category` | Filter by app category |
| `lazyweb_search` with `company` | Filter by company |
| `lazyweb_search` with `platform: "desktop"` | Search desktop/web screenshots only |
| `lazyweb_search` with `platform: "mobile"` | Search mobile app screenshots only |
| `lazyweb_search` with `high_design_bar: true` | Filter to companies marked `companies.high_design_bar = true` |
| `lazyweb_compare_image` | Find screenshots visually similar to an image URL or base64 image |
| `lazyweb_find_similar` | Find screenshots similar to one you already found |
| `list_companies_by_categories` with `high_design_bar: true` | Return only high-design-bar company IDs for composition |
| `lazyweb_find_experiments` | Find generic A/B experiment evidence from Lazyweb's experiments table |
| `lazyweb_recent_experiments` | Pull the latest 10, 25, or 50 generic experiment rows |
| `lazyweb_ab_test_research` | Turn experiment evidence into PM-facing A/B test research and strategy |

These public `lazyweb_*` tool names are compatibility aliases on `https://www.lazyweb.com/mcp`.
They map to the current canonical MCP tools such as `search_screenshots`,
`list_filters`, `vision_screenshots`, and `metadata_screenshots`.

Use MCP tools for all Lazyweb database access.

Use `high_design_bar: true` when the user asks for high-design-bar companies,
premium examples, best-designed apps, or stronger visual-quality filtering. This
applies to design tools such as `lazyweb_search`, `lazyweb_find_similar`, and
`lazyweb_compare_image`, and to A/B tools such as `lazyweb_find_experiments`,
`lazyweb_recent_experiments`, and `lazyweb_ab_test_research`.

For category-scoped A/B work, call `list_companies_by_categories` first and
then pass the returned `company_ids` into `lazyweb_find_experiments`.
`lazyweb_find_experiments` reads generic experiment evidence and must not be
treated as paywall-only.

## Output format

All skills produce a report with downloaded reference images:

```
.lazyweb/{skill}/{topic}-{date}/
├── report.html        <- Structured findings with inline images
└── references/        <- Downloaded screenshots (persisted locally)
    ├── stripe-pricing-page.png
    ├── linear-onboarding.png
    └── ...
```

Open `report.html` in any browser to see the screenshots inline.

## Repository structure

- `browse/src` — CLI runtime, browser automation, and tool orchestration.
- `browse/test` — unit and integration tests for command and browser behavior.
- `scripts/validate-plugin.mjs` — quick plugin validation entrypoint.
- `plugins/lazyweb` — packaged plugin payload consumed by Codex/Claude connectors.
- `plugins/lazyweb/skills` — individual skill definitions and prompts.

## Development

### Install and test

```bash
npm install
npm test
```

The test command runs plugin validation checks used by the plugin marketplace and local CI.

### Verify MCP registration

1. Install or load the plugin package in your host.
2. Confirm each lazyweb skill shows under your MCP namespace.
3. Run one smoke command such as `lazyweb_search` for a simple query:

```json
{"query":"pricing page","limit":3}
```
