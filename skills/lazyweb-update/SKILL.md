# Lazyweb Update

Use this skill for maintenance only: update the installed Lazyweb skill pack,
reinstall the local skills, and verify the active clients can see the result.
Do not run design research from here.

## Run the update

Use the bundled updater when available:

```bash
"$HOME/.lazyweb/bin/lazyweb-update" --host all --quiet
```

If that file is missing because the install is old, bootstrap once from GitHub:

```bash
set -euo pipefail
REPO="${LAZYWEB_SKILL_REPO:-https://github.com/aboul3ata/lazyweb-skill}"
TARGET="${LAZYWEB_SKILL_DIR:-$HOME/.lazyweb/repos/lazyweb-skill}"
mkdir -p "$(dirname "$TARGET")"
if [ -d "$TARGET/.git" ]; then
  git -C "$TARGET" pull --ff-only
else
  rm -rf "$TARGET"
  git clone --depth 1 "$REPO" "$TARGET"
fi
"$TARGET/setup" --host all --quiet
```

The public installer remains:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://www.lazyweb.com/install.sh | bash
```

But for this skill, prefer the commands above because they explicitly reinstall
every supported local skill root with `--host all`.

## Verify

After the updater finishes:

1. Print the before and after git commit for
   `~/.lazyweb/repos/lazyweb-skill` when available.
2. Check that `lazyweb-update/SKILL.md` exists under any detected local skill
   roots, especially `~/.codex/skills` and `~/.claude/skills`.
3. Run `~/.lazyweb/bin/lazyweb-update-check`; it should print nothing when the
   installed version is current.
4. If Lazyweb MCP tools are available in the current client, run
   `lazyweb_health`. If the current session cannot see MCP tools or newly
   installed skills, tell the user to reload or restart the client; local skill
   discovery is not always hot-loaded.

Summarize the updated commit/version, which clients were refreshed, and any
client that needs a restart.
